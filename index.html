          First of all, the programming is a mess.<br>

          <img src="assets/mess.png" alt="toxic pool" />

          When I first began to learn how to code I began by taking a course
              at codecademy, started with some HTML/CSS.<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          Tags, attributes, selectors, hey I’m getting pretty good at this!<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          Finished that, next course: Javascript.<br>

          <em>Cool.</em><br>

          I did this in high-school. Loops, conditions, functions… Hey this
              isn’t too bad!<br>

          <strong>Finished.</strong><br>

          I was feeling pretty good at this point…<br>

          <strong>Until I actually wanted to create something.</strong><br>

          Funny enough I found out that this is pretty much why the industry
          changes so often.

            Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, data
                structures, databases…<br>

            And those are just the TOOLS.<br>

            Then you have authentication, sessions, cookies, caching, server
                requests, parsing data…<br>

            <em>Oh. My. God.</em><br>

            I fell into what is known as “informed pessimism”.<br>

            How am I going to learn all of this?<br>

            Well I’ve spent a long time in the “Valley of Despair”, but what I
              realize about programming is that even people who have been doing
              this for 7 years are still learning <strong>everyday!</strong>

            Learning is to be expected and it can become one of the most
              fulfilling and fun parts of programming.<br>

            Things chance very quickly, but thankfully, so can our brains.<br>

            <strong>And so today I will give you some resources to help you add
              learning to your skills.</strong>

        <h1>How The Brain Learns</h1>

      </header>

      <div class="container">

        <div class="panel">

          <p class="para">

            The brain is very complex so we are going to simplify things
              into two different modes: Focused and Diffused.<br>

            We will be using a pinball machine for analogy.<br>

            When you think a thought, the pinball is launched and it travels
              along the pathways that you’ve already laid. The stronger
              those pathways are the easier it is to recall that thought.<br>

            However what if you want to think a new thought that you’ve never
              thought of before?<br>

            At the bottom you’ll notice some black lines that represent a
              thought you would like to have.<br>

            How do you get to those pathways?<br>

            <img src="assets/thought.jpg" alt="modes of thinking" />

            The diffuse mode.<br>

            In the diffuse mode of thinking you’re able think a wider range
              of thoughts and connect to farther apart ideas to each other.<br>

            The way you enter the diffuse mode is by turning your attention
              away from what you’re doing and letting your brain focus on
              different things.<br>

            That’s why sometimes when you’re unable to solve a problem the
              answer will pop into your head a bit after you’ve moved on.<br>

            Stepping away from science, and back to practicality, how do you get
              better and get to learning all this awesome cool stuff?<br>

            Build understanding, practice, repeat.

          	When you focus on problems you’ve solved before the process is
              painless and quick, you arrive at the solution without effort.<br>

          	However when you’re encountering new problems, don’t get
              frustrated. It helps to understand the underlying concepts so
              don't be afraid to do some research.<br>

            Keep working through it and allow your brain to
              form those new pathways and you'll be picking things
              up way faster than you thought!<br>

            All it takes to be good at something is 20 hours. In fact what
              you’ll notice is any skill is actually a set of sub-skills.<br>

            There are a ton of things you can learn and the ONLY thing stopping
              you is 20 hours.<br>

            Now those 20 hours are going to be confusing, frustrating perhaps,
              but realize that it’s just apart of the process to becoming
              competent.<br>
